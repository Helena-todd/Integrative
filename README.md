All code used to process the metabolomic, transcriptomic and CyTOF data from the two cohorts analysed in the paper can be found in the /script folder. In this folder, readers will find all functions that were used to process the data, as well as scripts and markdowns. Compiled html files associated with these markdowns were added to this github repository, to allow visualisation of results even if the readers do not wish to knit the R markdowns themselves, or to download the data necessary to do so.
